3. Camera input → Real-time pose detection and form analysis
4. Progress tracking → Dashboard updates and history storage

## 🎯 Exercise Detection Algorithms

### Push-ups
- **Detection Method**: Elbow-to-shoulder angle analysis
- **Rep Trigger**: Arm extension/flexion cycle
- **Form Scoring**: Body alignment and range of motion

### Squats
- **Detection Method**: Hip-to-knee distance measurement
- **Rep Trigger**: Descent and ascent pattern
- **Form Scoring**: Depth and posture analysis

### Lunges
- **Detection Method**: Knee separation and position
- **Rep Trigger**: Forward/backward lunge movement
- **Form Scoring**: Balance and angle assessment

### Plank
- **Detection Method**: Body alignment from head to heels
- **Duration Tracking**: Continuous form maintenance
- **Form Scoring**: Straight line posture evaluation

## 🔧 Configuration

### Dark Theme
The application uses a custom dark theme configured in `.streamlit/config.toml`:
```toml
[theme]
primaryColor = "#667eea"
backgroundColor = "#0E1117"
secondaryBackgroundColor = "#262730"
textColor = "#FAFAFA"
base = "dark"
```

### Server Settings
```toml
[server]
headless = true
address = "0.0.0.0"
port = 5000
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting
